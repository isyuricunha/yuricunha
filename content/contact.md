# Get in Touch

Need to contact me?

I'm intermittently active on Mastodon, so you can try me there as [@isyuricunha@isyuricunha.social](https://isyuricunha.social/@isyuricunha).

If you're curious about my code stuff, you can find me as [isyuricunha on GitHub](https://github.com/isyuricunha). Although most of my recent personal projects are in private repos as I'm releasing those as paid apps.

If you've got a longer message, drop me a line via this contact form, although I've gotten worse at answering emails in the past few years.
