Corporate Runaways
==================

[Corporate Runaways](http://www.corporaterunaways.com/) is the travel blog that Kay and I keep of our journeys. We've blogged five trips:

*   [Boston to Ushuaia](http://www.corporaterunaways.com/trips/boston-to-ushuaia/): Kay and I travel on two BMW F650GS motorcycles from Boston to the bottom of the world - Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. In four months, we covered ~18,000 miles, made new friends, ate many tasty foods, and had excellent adventures. We're working toward another big trip like this, but without a deadline or plan to return home at the end.
*   [Boston to Colorado](http://www.corporaterunaways.com/trips/boston-to-colorado/): Kay and I load the dogs into a Ural sidecar motorcycle and take off cross-country for a BMW F650GS meetup in Colorado. Dogs + sidecar motorcycle = entertainment.
*   [Boston to Nova Scotia](http://www.corporaterunaways.com/trips/nova-scotia/): Still trying to make the Ural work, Kay and I take a smaller 16-day trip the following year to Nova Scotia with the dogs in the sidecar. Spoiler alert: it rains. A lot. As much as we (mostly I) love motorcycling, this trip made us decide a different method of travel might be appropriate.
*   [Boston to Arizona](http://www.corporaterunaways.com/trips/boston-to-arizona/): Kay and I attempt to get to Overland Expo in Arizona in our 1981 VW Vanagon camper van. All does not go according to plan. (Only a few blog posts - we didn't blog this trip well.)
*   [Boston to California](http://www.corporaterunaways.com/trips/boston-to-california/): Kay and I load the dogs into the much more reliable Subaru Outback, and take off for a good old road trip across the United States. I finally visit the few states I haven't seen yet (including the entire West Coast) and have a misadventure with a wisdom tooth infection.
