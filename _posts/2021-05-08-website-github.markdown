Our new website and Github page are now live.

We are thrilled to announce that "The Mouse Team" has just joined Github. Our aim is to contribute to the open source Android community by publishing our "Mouse Original apps" over the next year. 

This move will help to accelerate the advancements in the Android community as well as showcase our portfolio and skills. 

Stay tuned !!
