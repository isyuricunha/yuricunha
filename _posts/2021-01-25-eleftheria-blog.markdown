Eleftheria is the Greek word Ελευθερία for freedom. Our freedom from this pandemic through this gigantic vaccination programme. The purpose of the app is to inform Greek citizens about the progress of the country’s COVID19 vaccination programme, encourage the citizens to get vaccinated and demonstrate that all together we will leave this crisis behind us.
