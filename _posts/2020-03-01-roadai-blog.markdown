Over the next 10 years, more and more self-driving cars will hit our roads. It is going to be a revolution in transportation. But according to recent studies, only 21% of people fully trust self-driving cars. With RoadAI Android app we decided to fill that gap. Using Artificial Intelligence, RoadAI intends to make people trust their transportation to self-driving cars by showing them how their phone and consequently a self-driving car perceives the world around it, acting as an intelligent co-driver. Simple setup a phone holder for cars and your phone. Self-driving cars promise safer roads for everyone and we decided to demonstrate that as well. In every driverâ€™s life, there have been incidents where they have missed a red traffic light or stop sign. RoadAI detects and vocally warns the driver of potential dangers making the driving experience much safer. RoadAI was presented at Facebook AI Online Hackathon.
