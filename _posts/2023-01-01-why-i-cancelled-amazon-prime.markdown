My love affair with Amazon Prime started in 2012. 

It was a revolutionary way of shopping that made it much more straightforward. You can get anything you need in two-day shipping (or faster) and have it at your fingertips. It is perhaps the most significant vehicle of consumerism in this modern age.

To someone who embraces every new technological leap, I found it highly appealing that it became quite an addiction. 

At first, it is the simplicity of buying things. Then it became the amazement with Amazon’s integration with home devices such as the Echo and the Fire TV. Next, Amazon Prime Video and Music worsened it, as these bundled services now justify the yearly subscription cost. Eventually, it became ingrained in my household as a necessary lifestyle instrument. 

Like the air I breathe, I can no longer function without it. 

### The True Cost of Amazon Prime

In 2012, my annual Amazon Prime subscription fee was $99. In 2018, Amazon raised the price to $119.

If I renew for 2023, the fee would be $139 annually.

At $11.58 per month, Amazon Prime has the following included features:

- Fast and free 1-2 days delivery. 
- Prime Video consists of some notable series and movies.
- Amazon Music for ad-free music and podcasts.
- Prime Gaming with selected free games.
- Amazon Kindle with some free books.

Now that is a good deal! Ad-free Netflix and Hulu alone cost more than the monthly subscription. It is genuinely a delicious offer that I justified without much guilt.

Yet this is just the drug to the addiction. It is the hook to the catch.

In about 10 years, I spent USD 59,265 through Amazon Prime with purchases. I do not typically monitor what I buy and treat it as if I go to a neighborhood store. Up until I look back through the years and ask myself, did I spend my money meaningfully?

What could I have purchased in cash for that amount, an essential item like my car? There certainly was a better use for my money.

I bought a lot of stuff. Some stuff would qualify as items that I genuinely need. A good amount of purchases were for things that I wanted. But the most significant spend would be for items that I *kinda liked*. In other words, items that are *junk*.

In short, I bought a lot of junk from Amazon Prime. These items are lying around the house unused for months and years: duplicates, low-quality Chinese stuff, and spur-of-the-moment desires.

Would I have spent the same amount buying stuff in traditional physical stores without Amazon Prime? Maybe. But why do I believe that the convenience of the online store manifested the compulsion? Because viewing items in a browser and responding to advertisements feed into the desire. 

> Modern targeted advertisements prey on consumers to desire something they don’t have so that they buy it. Advertisements target the subconscious, quietly whispering that my life will only matter, can be changed, or have meaning when I have the item in possession.

Further analysis of my trending habits with Amazon Prime indicates that most of my expenses were for low-priced items. For example, look at the graph above; the density of low-priced items is evident compared to the more expensive ones. 

I had two significant acquisitions that cost more than $2,000. 

My biggest purchase through Amazon Prime is my Napoleon Grill, which costs $2,799. The item is a great product; I use it for my grilling needs.

I purchased a $2,399 Zero-G massage chair and have used it daily for the last four years. It is still in excellent condition. It helps in reducing the day-to-day stress of working from home. 

These items are worth the cost and truly add value to my life. However, the remaining items I own, totaling a staggering $53,000, do not. I genuinely do not know what among these items I value the most. The low-cost things accumulated through the years are the most significant cost killer. Most of them are either non-essential or the kind that comes from a factory in China that entices you through crassly-designed Facebook advertisements.

Suppose I look around my house and garage. In that case, I see the hint and shadows of these items everywhere, but that’s it - they are all superficial items - fillers that cater to some specific dopamine-releasing high at the time of purchase.

> Today is *day one* for me - the day one of self-control and change.

I want to begin with a brute force change to cull the impulse. I am entirely terminating Amazon Prime with all its goodies so as not to be tempted. Would I pull it off by not unsubscribing and monitoring my spending habits? Perhaps, but more than likely not. I am a creature of habit and urge - but I also have a sincere goal of bettering myself.

It is throwing away the key that opens the door to online consumerism.

### What Adds Meaning and Value to My Life

What am I giving up by letting go of Amazon Prime? Are there things that have value in my life that I will miss? Are they replaceable, or are they duplicates of other things I already have? Will my life be better or worse with less?

I want to explore these items or services at a time.

##### 1-2 Days Prime Delivery

I believe Amazon Prime’s 1-2 Days Free Delivery is the core engine of their enterprise. Without it, it may have been impossible to become this massive global giant. They heavily capitalized and invested in their logistics strategy to quickly make items available to their customers.

But just like any sales promotion tactic such as BOGOs (Buy One Get One), this is simply a marketing strategy.

It is a pure enticement. It creates the allure and whets your appetite into buying things you may not truly want or need. It makes purchasing a form of emergency.

One of my favorite podcasts, [The Minimalists](https://theminimalists.com), plays a tune at the beginning of their talk show. It is a song by Peter Doran entitled Every Little Thing and clearly shows what we are doing wrong.

*Every little thing, you think that you need*<br>
*Every little thing, you think that you need*<br>   
__*Every little thing that’s just feeding your greed*__<br>
*Oh, I bet that you’d be fine without it*

> Yes, I bet that I’d be fine without it.

A decade ago, buying items you genuinely need is physical exercise. You first find a store; you physically browse until you’re excited. Then, you hold the item in your hand. Finally, you debate whether you need it, want it, or just *kinda*.

Nowadays, virtual browsing has supplanted this exercise. We no longer know what we are purchasing. We can no longer rely on our senses: how the item feels in our hand, smells, or even looks up close. Instead, product influencers, virtual advertisements, bait clicks, and product reviews are now driving the retail world.

By not availing of Amazon Prime, I can free myself from this temptation. I can delay gratification when I feel the buying rush. And if I want or need something, I must work hard to get it. In the process, I bet I will end up not buying it at all. Wouldn’t that be nice?

##### Prime Video

When it comes to Prime Video content, it is a hit or miss. But overall, I don't have any memorable recollection of any TV series I would rewatch on this platform.

I happen to have Netflix, which is also up for debate. However, I get Disney Plus with my mobile provider as a bundle and HBO Max from AT&T Internet. So my streaming needs are covered, or my family is, as they will be the first ones to complain.

I will not miss Prime Video. I think they tried hard to compete with the other streaming services, not to mention attempting very hard to make catastrophic series like the bastardization of the Tolkien world (I do not think I can ever forgive).

Overall, it does not add value to my life. Regardless, I intend to reduce my streaming clutter, and I am glad I got one out of the way as part of this.

##### Alexa and the Amazon Echos

![Echos]({{site.baseurl}}/images/001-4.jpeg)

A few years ago, on a Black Friday or a Prime Day, I was so enamored by the technological idea of Alexa and the Amazon Echos.

Alexa is a voice assistant who can perform several tasks for you. It can set alarms, control your smart home devices and even play music. Amazon Echo is the device that has Alexa built-in and becomes the geeky wonder that is a vehicle for the cool stuff. It is like an always-on speaker that you can talk to, and it will respond to your commands.

The idea of robots in my life has always enamored me. Robot vacuum cleaners, AI-driven devices, and switches that react to physical action, among other things, are perfect advertiser ammunition against me. If you throw this techy stuff in front of my face, bundle it with an enticing video, and convince me that my life is not complete without them, the courtship is over.

Alexa and the Amazon Echos became members of our family. We would no longer want to physically turn our heads or walk a few steps to check out the time or the weather because why bother - Alexa can take care of it for you. Do we want to blast some mood-based music in a room or the entire house? That is just a simple instruction to Alexa. She will suggest many things I do not need before playing the songs. If I want to have a video call with my friends with similar devices, the Echo will do just that, albeit with the horribly-lagged video and call. It even integrates with security devices and cameras in the house, like the Ring doorbell. And worse, why bother browsing when you can tell Alexa to do it for you if you want to purchase something online?

Life sucks without Alexa.

But does it?

For the majority of the time, after careful thought and reflection, I now believe they are glorified alarm clocks. It might be essential to have precisely one Amazon Echo in the house. But one in every room? I think I went overboard.

Would they be missed if I ditch all these devices at once? Would I have been OK with just one? Have I added clutter not only to my physical environment but also to my digital life? Have I added more screens to view and detract from the meaningful interactions with my family?

With the removal of Amazon Prime, I lose some features in the Amazon Echo devices. The most prominent one would be that I will lose the ability to play unlimited music. But this is not the world’s end since my main ad-free, and lossless music source is Apple Music. And it would stream into the Echo without that much change.

Without Amazon Prime, these gadgets would no longer be a medium for me to quickly order stuff simply by saying it. 

It is time to have one less clutter from these devices.

I currently have three Amazon Echos that have screens. On top of that, I have about five Amazon Echo Dots in every hallway and the guest room. I even have one in the garage and patio. As part of decluttering, I will let go of the Echo Dots. Instead, the screen-enabled Echos will remain in the kitchen, my son’s room, and the living room. This decision will be my compromise, and I will re-evaluate this after a few months.

I will try to get some freedom back from the clutches of these devices.

##### Amazon Music

![Amazon Music]({{site.baseurl}}/images/001-5.jpeg)

Amazon Music is a music service that offers its customers the ability to stream and download music and create their playlists. 

With Amazon Prime subscription, I got unlimited ad-free streaming and podcasts as part of the bundle.

Was it convenient? Yes. 

Is it better compared to Apple Music’s lossless audio and music selection? No.

I think Amazon Music’s selection of playlists and songs and their audio quality are inferior to Apple Music. In addition, the mobile app is not as tightly-integrated into the built-in capabilities of the Apple-owned service. Using it with CarPlay in my vehicles is also not as fluid as Apple’s.

I do not think I will miss Amazon Music. It is one less clutter in the duplicated service I prefer for streaming music.

##### Amazon Prime Reading

I don’t recall finding a reading-worthy book that came free as part of the Amazon Prime Reading bundle. Perhaps if you like a lot of fluffy novels with very little depth - but even that is a long shot.

Whenever I find a book to read with Amazon Kindle, it will always be one I either have to purchase or part of the Kindle Unlimited subscription that I do not wish to avail myself.

Did this service add value and meaning to my life? No.

### One Less Clutter

Dear reader, welcome to **One Less Clutter**.

I decided to change my life and live with less. It will be a long journey as I have accumulated too much stuff. It is not only confined to physical objects but digital and emotional ones. I want to free myself from the ties that bind me to the non-essential. I want to live a meaningful life for myself and my family.

> My *credo* is a form of minimalism, but it is my kind of minimalism.

Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus of [The Minimalists](https://theminimalists.com) heavily influence me. Yet everything that I will do only applies to me. The result of my blogging will be twofold: to document my success or failure in the journey and to gain feedback and ideas from you.

After careful contemplation, I chose to unsubscribe from Amazon Prime to radically alter one clutter that I think has a significant impact on my life. 

I will not be preaching or telling you what to do. I will not pretend that what works in my life works with you. But I will share it all with you. 

And maybe, just maybe, we can help each other achieve something extraordinary - a meaningful life with *one less clutter* at a time.
