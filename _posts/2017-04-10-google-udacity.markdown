Out of more than 10,000 students in the "Android Scholarship for EU Developers" in April 2017, our Android developer got selected based on their work as one of the 1250 winners for a full 3-month scholarship to the "Android Basics Nanodegree By Google" via Udacity.

About the scholarship:

>Thatâ€™s why today Google, Bertelsmann (the global media, services and education company) and e-learning provider Udacity are coming together with a goal of closing the mobile digital skills gap in Europe and preparing the new European workforce with the mobile development skills needed to help them get a job or start their own business.
