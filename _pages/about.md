I have always been a person who is intrigued by minimalism. I am not talking about the modern minimalist movement that has become popular in recent years, but the true essence of minimalism. The idea is that less is more and that we should only surround ourselves with things necessary to our lives. We should be able to live with less and still be happy and content.

I have always admired the appeal of a minimalist lifestyle, and I think I’ve been in denial for a long time. I filled my life with so many unnecessary things, and it’s about time I took responsibility for it. 

I have a lot of useless stuff that I don’t need. I think I am more aware of what I have now than in the past, and it feels good to get rid of some stuff. It might be a bit scary at first - we are so used to these objects, and they become our friends - but we can always replace them with better things later.

I will document this journey for my purpose, and I hope you join me on the ride. It will be a struggle, but I am willing to do it with __*one less clutter*__ at a time.
