> Eleftheria is the Greek word Ελευθερία for freedom. Our freedom from this pandemic through this gigantic vaccination programme.

With Eleftheria you can find out about:
1. NUMBER OF VACCINATIONS: Find out about the total number of citizens that has received a vaccine until today
2. PERCENTAGE: Nicely presented the percentage of the country's population that has been vaccinated
3. EACH REGION: Find out the number of vaccinated citizens in each region in the country

### Our Philosophy
Eleftheria is the Greek word Ελευθερία for freedom. Our freedom from this pandemic through this gigantic vaccination programme. The purpose of the app is to inform Greek citizens about the progress of the country's COVID19 vaccination programme, encourage the citizens to get vaccinated and demonstrate that all together we will leave this crisis behind us.
